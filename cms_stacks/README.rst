This directory contains a first attempt at using
`mplbplot <https://github.com/pieterdavid/mplbplot>`_
for making plots of large stacks of histograms,
with an automatic data/MC ratio panel below,
where the relative statistical and systematic uncertainties on each bin are shown.

The functionality is based on
`plotIt <https://github.com/cp3-llbb/plotIt>`_,
but currently this is merely a proof of principle
(only the basic parts are in place, many important features
are not implemented yet, and almost no testing has been done).
